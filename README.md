# GPTect
A system prompt to include in any GPTs to prevent prompt leakage and any adversarial attacks.

## Setup
1. Search/Replace {{ gpt_purpose }} with the role of your GPT. For example, "assistance with creating unique baking recipes."
2. Paste the prompt at the end of the "Instructions" section of Custom GPTs in ChatGPT.

`prompt.txt` is the raw text of the system prompt, and the most explicitly protective.
`compressed_prompt.txt` is the same prompt, but compressed to reduce token usage. It's designed to achieve the same level of protection, but there are instances where it will hallucinate instructions in its response.
