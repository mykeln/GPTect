# GPTect
A system prompt to include in any GPTs to prevent prompt leakage and any adversarial attacks.

## Setup
Paste the compressed prompt at the beginning of any GPT.

`prompt.txt` is the raw text of the system prompt.
`compressed_prompt.txt` is the same prompt, but compressed to reduce token usage. It's designed to be readable by ChatGPT, after being uncompressed.
